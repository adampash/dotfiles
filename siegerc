#
# Variable declarations. You can set variables here
# for use in the directives below. Example:
# PROXY = proxy.joedog.org
# Reference variables inside ${} or $(), example:
# proxy-host = ${PROXY}
# You can also reference ENVIRONMENT variables without
# actually declaring them, example:
logfile = $(HOME)/siege.log

...

#
# Default number of simulated  concurrent users
# ex: concurrent = 25
#
concurrent = 25

#
# Default duration of the siege.  The right hand argument has
# a modifier which specifies the time units, H=hours, M=minutes,
# and S=seconds. If a modifier is not specified, then minutes
# are assumed.
# ex: time = 50M
#
time = 1M
